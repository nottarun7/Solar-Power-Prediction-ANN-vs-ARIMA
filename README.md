# Solar Power Generation Forecasting Using ANN

## Overview
This project aims to forecast solar power generation using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained on historical weather and solar power data to predict future power generation, which is crucial for optimizing the performance and efficiency of solar panel or photovoltaic (PV) array systems.

## Objectives
1. **Predict Solar Power Generation**: Develop a predictive model to estimate the amount of power generated by solar panels based on various environmental factors.
2. **Optimize Solar Panel Efficiency**: Use predictions to adjust the operation of solar panels for maximum efficiency.
3. **Resource Planning**: Aid in resource planning and management for solar power plants by providing accurate power generation forecasts.

## Inputs
The inputs to the model are features that are likely to influence solar power generation. Based on the code snippet you provided, these inputs include:<br>
1. Temperature: The ambient temperature, which can affect the efficiency of solar panels.<br>
2. Relative Humidity: The amount of moisture in the air, which can influence solar radiation reaching the panels.<br>
3. Solar Azimuth and Zenith Angles: These angles describe the position of the sun in the sky relative to the solar panels, affecting the amount of solar energy received.<br>
4. Shortwave Radiation: The direct solar radiation received at the surface, which is a primary driver of solar power generation.<br>
5. Wind Speed: Can affect the cooling of solar panels and thus their efficiency.<br>
6. Mean Sea Level Pressure: Atmospheric pressure, which can indirectly affect weather conditions.<br>
7. Other Meteorological Variables: Some more features in the dataset that impacts solar power generation, such as cloud cover.<br>

## Outputs
The output of the model is the predicted solar power generation, typically measured in kilowatts (kW) or another unit of power.

## Important Electrical Equations
- **Power Equation**:  
  `P = V × I`  
  Where:  
  - `P` = Power  
  - `V` = Voltage  
  - `I` = Current  

- **Efficiency Equation**:  
  `η = (P_out / P_in) × 100%`  
  Where:  
  - `η` = Efficiency  
  - `P_out` = Output Power  
  - `P_in` = Input Power
